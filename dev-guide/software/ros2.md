## Installing ROS2 on the NavQPlus

We have prepared an install script that will install ROS2 and all necessary packages on the NavQPlus.

To get the install script and run it, you can run the following in the terminal:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rudislabs/nxp_install/main/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
