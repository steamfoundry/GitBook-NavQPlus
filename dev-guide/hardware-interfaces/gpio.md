# GPIO

There are several ports which may have or may be configured for GPIO connection. In addition there are several SMT pads designed to allow access to GPIO and signals such as the PMIC controls. Refer to the schematics for details.

<\<TODO - add more detail here, and pictures of the schematics. Add an example pin access if available>>
