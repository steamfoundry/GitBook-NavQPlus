# LVDS

A LVDS LCD display interface using 1-2 ribbon cable connectors is available on the backside of NavQPlus. Refer to the schematics for details. This is an advanced configuration to drive LCD glass directly.

Note that using the HDMI interface for a small embedded display or attaching to a commercial monitor is the easiest way to have a display available. Generally this will work out of the box without modification to the code.&#x20;
