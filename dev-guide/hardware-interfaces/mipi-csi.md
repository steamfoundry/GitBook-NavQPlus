# MIPI CSI (Camera)

## Connecting the Google Coral Camera

{% hint style="danger" %}
CAUTION IF the Google Coral Camera is connected **backwards**, it will cause a short circuit and burn out both the MIPI-CSI cable and the sensor in the camera. Please see the images below on how to properly connect the Google Coral Camera to the NavQPlus.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
One Google Coral camera is included with most NavQPlus kits. The NavQPlus does support two MIPI-CSI Cameras simultaneously. Additional Google Coral cameras and extended ribbon cables are available from Google, or other retailers. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

Pin 1 (P1) on the Google Coral Camera should be connected to the pin with the arrow on the MIPI-CSI port. Please see the images below. The sides with the red box should line up. You should see the blue on the flex cable when connecting to the MIPI-CSI port.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Image reference of how the camera should be connected to the NavQPlus. Please note the orientation of the flex cable. **This is very important!**

## Camera Mount&#x20;

Depending on your kit, there may be a tall or short camera mount included. The short version typically ships with the NavQPlus or drone itself, while a tall version may come with an MR-Buggy3 development kit. Please refer to the image below for information on how to assemble.&#x20;

The camera mount is provided unassembled.

{% hint style="info" %}
See drawing PDF below. Note the three three screws (item 10) and nuts (item 8) that connect the inner case (item3) to the camera adapter (item 2). This is a little difficult to see on the drawings.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
FYI the camera mount base is designed to be compatible with other off the shelf "action cameras" and uses a #10-32 screw to attach. Other designs, accessories or modifications can easily be 3d printed and adapted.
