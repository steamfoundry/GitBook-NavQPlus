# MIPI DSI

A MIPI DSI interface using a ribbon cable connector is available on the backside of NavQPlus. Refer to the schematics for details.\


{% hint style="info" %}
Note that using the HDMI interface for a small embedded display or attaching to a commercial monitor is the easiest way to have a display available. Generally this will work out of the box without modification to the code.&#x20;
