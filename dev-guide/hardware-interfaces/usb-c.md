# USB-C

## Port configuration

The setup for NavQPlus USB ports are as follows:

USB 1: USB-C port closest to the edge of the board. This port is used for _connecting_ devices, such as USB-C hubs, cameras, sensors, and more.

USB 2: USB-C port closest to the middle of the board. This port is used for _powering_ the board, as seen in the Power page in the User Guide. This port accepts USB-C PD, and also allows data transfer. USB Gadget Ethernet is supported over this port with the interface `usb0`.
